# Pomodoro Timer App

## Overview

The Pomodoro Timer App is a simple desktop application designed to help you manage your time efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique. This time management method is based on working in focused intervals, usually 25 minutes long, followed by short breaks. After several intervals, a longer break is taken. This technique helps improve productivity and reduce burnout.

## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves the following key steps:

1. **Work for 25 minutes**: Set a timer for 25 minutes and focus on a single task until the timer goes off.
2. **Take a short break**: After the 25 minutes of work, take a short break, typically 5 minutes.
3. **Repeat**: After completing four Pomodoro intervals (totaling about 100 minutes of work and 15 minutes of breaks), take a longer break, usually 15-30 minutes.

This cycle of working and breaking helps maintain focus and productivity, while also giving your mind time to rest and recharge.

## Application Features

- **Start Timer**: Initiates the Pomodoro cycle, with alternating work periods and breaks.
- **Reset Timer**: Allows you to stop the current timer and reset the application to its initial state.
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows the current state of the timer with visual cues and updates.
- **Notifications**: Alerts you when itâ€™s time to work or take a break.
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays check marks to indicate the completion of Pomodoro intervals.

## How It Works

The application uses Python's Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface. It manages the timing and displays notifications for work periods and breaks. The work and break intervals are customizable, and the app provides visual feedback and progress tracking through a simple interface.

## Customization

You can adjust the following parameters to fit your preferred Pomodoro intervals:

- **Work Time**: Duration of work sessions (default: 20 minutes).
- **Short Break Time**: Duration of short breaks (default: 5 minutes).
- **Long Break Time**: Duration of long breaks (default: 20 minutes).

Feel free to modify these settings to better match your workflow and productivity needs.
